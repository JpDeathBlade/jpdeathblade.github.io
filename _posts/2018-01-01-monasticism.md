三日坊主 (Mikka Bouzu)

I'm the type of person who will get an idea, be super jazzed about it, start on a new project and within a week given up on the whole thing. The Japanese have a phrase for this which I've written above. It translate to "three-day monk".

So today I start my monkhood determined to finish at least one project. Be that posting here every day for a year, or finally having an application in the iOS App Store. I'm determined to not give up on at least one project this year.
