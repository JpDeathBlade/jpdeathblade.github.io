Since the site has many authors, I need a way to let the users know who is posting what but also give them a preview of each blog post before they click through to the post itself. If everything worked out then you should be able to read this on the home page.

Skinning the posts was easy. Each one is a list item element in an unordered list. So I just had to create some elements to structure each post (avatar on the left, content on the right) and then add some CSS to skin everything. Nothing hard.

Jekyll also offers a way to grab the first paragraph from a post so you can display it as a preview through excerpt, a method of the post object. You can even override how much or how little Jekyll will grab and display. Pop that into the list item and now all the blog posts have previews.

Now for the hardest part: making everything look good...
